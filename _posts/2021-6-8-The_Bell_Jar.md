title: Reading Journal 1 - The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath
---

_On a side note, my reading journals often contain spoilers so do keep that in mind!_

## Summary (in 3 sentences)
Esther Greenwood works as a guest editor at a fashion in New York
She spirals into a deep depression after her stint there ends, as she was rejected from her dream writing course in university, and she gradually loses her sense of purpose in life. Her descent into insanity is greatly detailed in the later half of the book (which is what captivated me the most personally).

## Overall Thoughts/Key Takeaways
### Feminism
Esther's thoughts are mostly transgressive, especially with regards to societal standards of women back then. I found her cynical views extremely entertaining; here are some snippets:

On anaesthesia as she witnesses childbirth:
>>"I thought it sounded just like the sort of drug a man would invent. Here was a woman in terrible pain, obviously feeling every bit of it or she wouldn't groan like that, and she would go straight home and start another baby, because the drug would make her forget how bad the pain had been, when all the time, in some secret part of her, that long, blind, doorless and windowless corridor of pain was waiting to open up and shut her in again."

On preserving her virginity:
>> "I couldn't stand the idea of a woman having to have a single pure life and a man being able to have a double life, one pure and one not. Finally I decided that if it was so difficult to find a red-blooded intelligent man who was still pure by the time he was twenty-one I might as well forget about staying pure myself and marry somebody who wasn't pure either."

(For context, the man she envisioned to be her future husband had just confessed that he'd slept around with a few women while he was still together with her; she had previously been adamant about preserving her virginity till marriage (as expected of unmarried women), but she was now steadfast about defying that expectation of her.)

Esther's refreshing perspectives and refusal to conform to societal norms were what probably appealed the most to female readers back then (and catapulted the book to success after Plath's death). 

### Mental Illness
Esther's descent into insanity hit me the hardest, especially with the knowledge that this book was semi-autobiographical (i.e. Plath's experiences are extremely similar to Esther's). Plath's descriptions are so vivid and haunting that simply reading about Esther's experiences was devastating for me. 

Presaging this were her offhanded comments about how her era of "winning scholarships and prizes" was "coming to an end", along with her uncertainty about her future after the conclusion of her internship. There comes a point when she's almost paralyzed by the sheer number of choices she has. 

>> "From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America...
>> I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."

I can't help but feel pained for her; life lets her down again and again, throwing all sorts of suffering at her. Right before she leaves New York to return home from her internship, she is beaten up and nearly raped; somehow, she clings on to a sense of hope, anticipation for life after the internship, only to be faced with critical rejection from her dream writing course, which essentially cuts off all plans she had envisioned for her future. 

Without anything to strive towards, she gradually loses her sense of purpose and her grasp on reality -- it is this that marks the start of insanity taking ahold of her.

The despair she's in and the apathy she feels towards the value of her life is heartbreaking. She makes three separate suicide attempts; even in the middle of her treatment, she makes plans to kill herself once again (but is hindered from doing so by her mother and brother). 

> I saw the years of my life spaced along a road in the form of telephone poles, threaded together by wires. I counted one, two, three. . . nineteen telephone poles, and then the wires dangled into space, and try as I would, I couldn't see a single pole beyond the nineteenth.

Tying in to the book's title, Esther starts bringing up the bell jar more towards the later half of the book. The bell jar in itself is a powerful metaphor for mental illness; it encapsulates the suffocation she felt, trapped within the confines of her own mind. The isolation she experienced in tackling her problems -- her mother simply couldn't grasp the complexity of the difficulties Esther faced, and society generally lacked understanding of mental illnesses back then with a persistent stigma against such illnesses, falling back on shock treatments in an attempt to restore patients' previous selves -- simply abetted the struggles along her path to recovery. Her inability to control when this bell jar will trap her again means that her mental illness serves as a sort of Democles' sword -- something that constantly looms over her, rather than something she can simply forget as a bad dream. 

### Some personal input
Plath is a wonderful writer. The foreword of the book briefly delves into how much despair Plath herself probably experienced as she wrote the book -- her tumultous divorce with Ted Hughes was widely publicized in the news, with her oftentimes painted as the villain, and she was left penniless with her children in the middle of harsh winters. It's a huge pity that this is her only novel; her writing is impactful, phenomenal, and I really wish I had the chance to read more of her works.

Saying that I understand her struggles would be severely undervaluing how much Esther actually went through. But I'm extremely grateful that I picked up this book. The shock and immense despair from having her seemingly straightforward plans derailed was something that struck me, mostly because I realised I too often fall back on a "fixed" path for the future; I couldn't help but feel as if her story is a foreboding of some sorts for my future, and that has certainly encouraged me to look to explore more options rather than assuming that there's already a clear path for me in life. 

More importantly, _The Bell Jar_ gave me a deeper understanding of the human psyche, and perhaps will enable me to better empathize with those struggling with depression. In a way, it's emboldened me to want to speak up more about mental illnesses, to reach out and help extricate those trapped in the claws of depression and alleviate their pain in some way or another. I don't feel qualified to review this book further -- I simply can't put the amazement (?) I feel about it in words. But rest assured that *The Bell Jar* is on my all-time-favorites list; it's an enlightening read, and I'd highly recommend this book for anyone. Here's a quote I stumbled upon that I feel is highly applicable here:

>> I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we are reading doesn't wake us up with a blow on the head, what are we reading it for? ...we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.
â€” Franz Kafka; January 27, 1904
