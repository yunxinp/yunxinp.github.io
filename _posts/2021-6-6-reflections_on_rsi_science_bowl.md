title: Reflections on RSI science bowl
---

A few weeks back, one of the other RSI scholars proposed hosting an RSI Science Bowl for fun. I had initially been on the fence about joining, as I didn't have any previous experience with buzzer-based competitions. But out of the blue, another Singaporean RSI scholar (who's now one of my friends!) invited me to form a team with him; I eventually conceded after his attempts at persuading me to join. 

So today we had a dry run before the actual event this Sunday. Here are some of my quick takeaways from today's session:

1. Be creative with the resources you have, and be proactive in creating opportunities for yourself and others! Tyler, the main host, mentioned that he coded the ScienceBowlPal Discord bot for his APCSP project. As someone who isn't really familiar with Discord bots in general, I thought it was pretty innovative to use Discord to host a virtual Science Bowl. And of course, I'm really glad he brought Science Bowl to RSI, since it was completely voluntary on his part.

2. Be bold in taking risks! Risk-taking is definitely required in such buzzer-based competitions -- you can take a shot at the MCQs with a 25% chance of success, or simply wait for the other team to propose an answer and utilize it as an opportunity to narrow down the options (if they get it wrong, that is). Given that there's no penalty for incorrect answers (at least in the RSI version), perhaps I'll be bolder in answering the questions; I've realised that there's nothing embarrassing about getting a question wrong, and that same mindset is very applicable in other settings as well. Overcoming the fear of looking stupid and not being afraid of making mistakes will open up more doors for you, in some way or another.

3. Learning is an everlasting process. Simply participating in one round of Science Bowl was enough for me to recognize the limits of what I know; I could only answer the Physics and Math questions, and I ended up having to rely on my teammates for the others. Yet, instead of feeling demoralized afterwards, I found myself more excited to learn more, to extend the boundaries of knowledge I possess, to absorb more information and enrich myself as much as possible. I guess there's definitely no limits to how much there is to learn; my thirst for new knowledge was only intensified further through Science Bowl. 

I'm really excited for the actual event to take place! Hopefully it'll go fine; regardless of the results, I believe it'll be a wonderful learning experience and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to take part in it :)
