title: The pursuit of everything
---

Learning is a captivating process. I've always felt that possessing just a bit of extra knowledge is very empowering. There's something inexplicably satisfying about being able to "better onself" by picking up a new interest, or becoming more adept at a skill. 

Because of this I've always had an insatiable hunger to learn everything. There are an infinite number of things you can learn -- whether it be how to cook a better steak or become a chess grandmaster -- and the unlimited availability of self-teaching resources online have only intensified my thirst for knowledge further. 

But it is precisely the accessibility of so many choices that often paralyzes me. After all, it's simply not possible to do everything at once; yet, recognizing how rare free time is for me now, I am desperate to maximize the holidays to pursue all my non-academic interests in one go. 

Recently, I got into vlogging -- I spent the whole of the past 2 days piecing together footage from my explorations the weekend before. Deeply vested in my spontaneous interest in videography, I also got myself a budget octopus tripod ($1.99 on Shopee). 

Besides that, I've also been attempting to make time for more reading (I've started on *What I Talk About When I Talk About Running* by Haruki Murakami, and am still trying to consolidate my thoughts for Sylvia Plath's *The Bell Jar*). I've also started this blog, and I'm trying to establish a regular writing habit (my plans for daily blogging have been unfortunately derailed due to many ad-hoc tasks). Despite being a STEM student, I really love literature and words; I think words are really beautiful if used with nuance.

I've also had fleeting interests in baking and cooking -- they're both deceptively simple -- as well as in art -- I used to spend hours watching portrait sketching tutorials on YouTube -- all of which I never ended up "specializing" in. 

Perhaps it's the feeling of novelty that encourages us to learn new things. Yet this feeling is transient. **Truly** learning something requires consistency, **discipline**, not fleeting desires or impulses. The learning curve often gets steeper near the middle, which is probably the segment that puts off most novices. From a utilitarian perspective, giving up barely after delving into a skill is tantamount to wasting much time and effort; after all, there is little "practical use" for a skill unless one has mastered it (and centers one's life around it, e.g. artists or programmers). 

I guess that has always been a concern that's plagued me: to pursue only skills/opportunities etc. based on their practical uses (and emphasize on mastery as the end goal), or to embark on numerous ventures at once for fun  (and risk becoming a diletantte). Essentially, a dilemma on whether it's worth spending my (limited) time on pursuits purely for enjoyment, since that time could always be "better" spent on something more "useful" in the future. And whether it's even worth spending time learning new skills, unless I'm absolutely sure that I'll see it through to the end and achieve mastery. 

I've also been pondering a lot about the relative importances of present enjoyment and future enjoyment, i.e. the idea of living in the now vs. for the future. Perhaps it's just me, but I've always felt that our society in Singapore focuses a lot more on the long-term, encouraging the mindset of working hard now so that you can reap the fruits of your labour in the future. This has compelled most of us to center their days around studying and achieving stellar academic grades in order for us not to "suffer in the future". But this unfortunately exacerbates the competitive culture present and limits the breadth of our non-academic experiences. 

However, I recognize that this could very well be me overthinking; after all, not everything is a zero-sum game, and nothing is absolute. It's true that focusing solely on a singular area leads to specialization faster -- you can even go down the ultralearning route, something that caught my attention for a while -- and may bring about more practical benefits. Yet, restricting yourself to one thing may end up being counterproductive, especially if you end up diminishing your interest in it completely. 

Ultimately, it is impractical to pursue everything at once. Something reassuring to think about, though, is that there's always time in the future to learn more; after all, I'd like to think that my lifespan will be pretty long, at least long enough for me to be able to cook a relatively decent steak for myself before I retire from life. 

My resolution, then, is to take everything in moderation. To delve into the things that interest me, rather than worrying excessively over the need to "master" the skill, but also not to spread myself out too much, focusing on just a few areas at once. And recognizing that it's perfectly fine to drop things if there's too much on my plate, while keeping in mind the need to be perseverant and consistent in my efforts. 

I think it's unfortunate that there's no clear answer or guideline that defines how you should approach learning, or how you should approach... anything, in general. But perhaps it is the freedom we have to pursue whatever we want that makes life so exciting. Ultimately, I believe what's key is maintaining our childlike curiosity in approaching the world and remaining open to exploring the endless possibilities life has to offer us; with this mindset, we'll never tire in the pursuit of everything.
