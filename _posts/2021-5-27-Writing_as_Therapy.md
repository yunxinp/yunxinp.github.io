title: Writing as Therapy
---

I've always had the yen to start a personal blog of some sorts -- a means of documenting the tidbits of thought that spontaneously come to life throughout my day, a means of archiving the meaningful material I chance upon, a means of logging the evolution of my thinking process over the years. 

Blogging, writing is a way of concretizing the abstract, solidifying these shapeless ideas onto paper for others to peruse. 

Writing in itself is therapeutic. I find that structuring my thoughts in a legible, coherent manner validates them; writing forces me to dig deep, to search for the roots of these arbitrary conjectures, to deconstruct these thoughts to the core feedback loops and trigger points that stimulate them. 

Writing helps me understand how I process things and understand myself better as a whole.

Writing also keeps things frozen in time; keeping a "physical" (albeit virtual) copy of my fleeting inspirations means gives me something to look back and reflect on in the future. I like the idea of having a curated collection of ideas I can fall back upon when I'm feeling vaguely lost in life, something to nudge me back on the right path in the midst of a rut. 

Either way, I believe it'll be an enjoyable passion project, especially if it's kept sustained. 

Which is, unfortunately, the most difficult part. Amidst my growing commitments and ever-growing pile of to-dos, simply posting an update doesn't always seem very feasible. 

But perhaps it is precisely this that I need: a cathartic release, to reconcile my worries and reinspire me when times get dull. 

That's it. Hope you'll have a good day ahead :")
