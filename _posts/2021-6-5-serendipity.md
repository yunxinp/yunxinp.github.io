title: On serendipity and luck

From [James Clear's 6/5/21 newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/may-6-2021):

>> “You can increase your surface area for good luck by taking action.
>> 
>> The forager who explores widely will find lots of useless terrain, but is also more likely to stumble across a bountiful berry patch than the person who stays home.
>> 
>> Similarly, the person who works hard, pursues opportunity, and tries more things is more likely to stumble across a lucky break than the person who waits.”

Luck is almost an essential factor to success. While we can't control when we'll get lucky, taking action enables **serendipity**. 

Rather than simply waiting around for an opportunity to strike, we should focus on what's in our control (i.e. our actions) and give everything we do a worthy effort; after all, we miss all the shots we don't take. Doing something at least guarantees that we'll have no regrets in the future (e.g. about being lazy and not maximizing an opportunity), regardless of success or failure.
