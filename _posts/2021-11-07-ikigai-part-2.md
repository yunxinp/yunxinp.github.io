title: Ikigai by Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles (part 2)
---

*This is a continuation from part 1, where I compiled all my takeaways from the book Ikigai. In this post, I'll be sharing more of my personal input after reading the book.*

## Overall thoughts
There are SO MANY things that resonated with me in this book. I was thoroughly enlightened, and in a sense, heartened that a book could reciprocrate my thoughts and feelings -- it made me feel less alone in the quagmire of my own thoughts.

There were a few particular concepts that stood out to me:

### Cultivating skills

Something mentioned in *Ikigai* is that learning a new skill can always be a means of finding meaning. Exposing ourselves to a completely new field altogether may seem a bit irrelevant, but it brings us a sense of freshness, a sense of excitement, and you never really know how beneficial possessing such a skill could be in the future.

One of the ideas proposed is Shinkansen sessions (*Gasshuku*), where one gathers (with a few friends, or sometimes alone) in a location away from one's conventional working location, and focuses a few days solely to work on cultivating a skill. This reminded me a lot of the concept of *Deep Work* -- working for a few hours at a time, but in immense concentration, which often leads to better working outcomes than working for a long time but constantly being distracted -- as well as on *Ultralearning* -- dedicating a longer period of time to a very curated and personalized learning curriculum, to learn a skill in a short period of time. (On a side note, I think it's really admirable how Scott Young, the author of *Ultralearning*, managed to finish the entire MIT 4-year undergraduate computer science curriculum within a year. That's four times faster than the conventional student, and definitely a lot of time saved!)

Such sessions are actually commonly practised in other countries as well. I have a friend in China who's enrolled herself in an art masterclass, where she (and her classmates) spend up to 12 hours a day for 5 days a week on painting. While this may seem a bit intense, I think it's really wonderful how such an intense session really boosts how quickly you pick up a skill, which ultimately saves you so much time while allowing for better results as well.

Personally, I'd really love to engage in one of such sessions; the idea of such a session is vaguely romantic, in the sense that you're truly dedicating yourself to mastering an art. I guess the only issue now is that I don't really have any skill in mind that I'd hope to learn, and finding someone who's willing to learn this skill with me is also very difficult. In general, finding a dedicated period of time to focus solely on a skill also sounds a bit unconventional, and it's not easy to find such a block of time without any external disturbances at all just to engage in a Shinkansen session. Nevertheless, it's definitely something that I'll keep in mind (and hopefully have the chance to do in the future).

### Trying new things, boldly

I think I particularly resonate with the passage on how boredom fuels creativity and work. In general, the main motivating factor for me to source for new opportunities in my life is boredom. Especially during the holidays, I've found myself mostly cooped up at home, drowning in the emptiness and meaninglessness of unfilled time passing continuously. So most of my wild ventures (during the holidays) (which include starting multiple blogs, attempting to learn to code, starting up numerous e-commerce websites etc.) have stemmed from my immense boredom, as well as an innate curiosity to explore.

Boredom and curiosity complement each other. As many often tout, curiosity is the most important trait that one must possess when learning anything, and I wholeheartedly agree. Without curiosity and a genuine wonder about anything and everything, even the most extreme cases of boredom-overload can't be resolved, because you simply find nothing interesting enough to allay your boredom.

As mentioned in the book *Ikigai*, most of our wildest childhood dreams and aspirations stemmed from our curiosity -- or more specifically, our ability to explore whatever caught our eye or piqued our interest, without fear of any judgment whatsoever. It is therefore so that perhaps our grandest ideas strike us when we are but small children. Revisiting your childhood aspirations is probably a good way to revive this curiosity, and willingness to explore, **boldly**. We were so innocent that all these barriers in our way now were practically invisible to us back then. 

I think it's a huge pity that we've been trained to narrow our sights, to be more "grounded" and realistic. The whole notion that dreams are "dreams" and not "goals to be achieved" is honestly a bit saddening -- it's held back many of us from just pushing forward and working ourselves to the bone just to achieve happiness. At the end of the day, perhaps we have the security, the certainty that we've desired, but is that really worth the emptiness and purposelessness that we're left with?

To this day there are still so many things I want to try. I've always dreamed of starting my own small business and achieving success, of being someone who's left an impact on the world in some way or another, or even just of completing a marathon. From first glance, some of these already seem much more practical and achievable than the others. I guess the main purpose of labelling how "possible" a dream is to fulfill is to avoid the disappointment that accompanies failure, but perhaps it's acting as a self-reinforcing barrier; perhaps it is such labels that ARE the barrier to us even daring to try.

There's also a significantly large concern about image. Perhaps this is mostly relevant in Singapore (and less relevant in other countries), but I've always been bogged down by a fear of failure and a fear of being judged for failing. I'm not sure why, but maintaining a seemingly "perfect" image and ensuring I leave a good impression on everyone has always been something I strive hard towards achieving. But it is precisely this desire for perfectionism that has held me back from trying new things, from pushing forward and chasing new opportunities without any concerns about failure whatsoever. 

Besides that, I find myself always concerned about whether I'm doing the right thing -- whether what I'm doing now will pay off, whether it will have any concrete impact or benefits in the future, or whether it is simply a waste of my time. This mindset is definitely problematic because, as mentioned in *Ikigai*, a lot of life is about such uncertainty -- we just have to trust our gut that the "dots will connect" in the future. For me, receiving such reassurance from a book (that it is completely normal to always face such uncertainty, and to do things anyway for the sake of doing them without worrying about whether it will eventually be useful) was really comforting; in a sense, it has enabled me to recognize that in our current position, there is no way we will know whether something will be "useful" or not in the future. I especially enjoyed the anecdote on Steve Jobs learning calligraphy, without any idea of how this would have such a long-lasting impact on the world eventually, in the form of the MacOS font. Reading *Ikigai* has encouraged me to doubt myself less, to trust myself more, to believe that I know what I'm doing, and that things will always work out in the end. 

I think I'm always grateful for the lessons I garner from the books that I read -- I'm thankful that *Ikigai* has given me the motivation to keep looking for more opportunities to explore, to enrich myself, to find meaning in life, without consistently doubting myself and my decisions. This sort of segways into the next point on creating opportunities for **serendipity** to occur -- whereby we keep engaging in opportunities and activities, such that there is a greater likelihood for a chance occurrence of luck and things playing out in an unexpected, happy way. 

### Creating opportunities for serendipity (and some personal input)

I really loved the chapter on serendipity. The ideas in it resonated with me a lot especially because encouraging serendipity has always been a "guiding principle" for me. I've tried to stay as open as possible to new ventures and new opportunities -- despite having practically zero experience -- because you truly never know what exploring such new fields could bring you! I genuinely believe in saying "yes" as much as possible (within my own means and not overtaxing myself, of course). It is in stepping out of our comfort zone and challenging the unfamiliar that we derive much wonder (from making new discoveries) and satisfaction (from gaining fresh experiences).

For me, some of the concrete actions that I'll take (on recommendation from the book) would probably be:
* Picking up a random book that isn't on my booklist (or, even better, from a genre I'd never usually touch) (and I ended up doing this, by heading over th)
* Reaching out to a friend I haven't talked to in a while and arranging for a coffee
* Doing something I have never done before (and ideally, doing something new every week)

Again, a lot of this is tied into curiosity and boredom as well; achieving serendipity requires us to TAKE ACTION -- any action is okay, as long as we're not just rotting at home on the couch. 

I've always feared having "nothing to do" -- those who know me well are probably familiar with me lamenting about how I hate blocks of unoccupied time accompanied by a lack of plans on what to do with that time. Because of that I'm constantly on the hunt for new opportunities, packing my schedule with everything possible, simply because I can't stand being bored, and I find learning new things very exciting too :)

Again, having my mindset of saying "yes" to as many things as possible and signing up for as many events as possible validated by a book was very reassuring. I felt a bit less lonely. Most whom I've shared my yearning for doing new things with have responded with much confusion -- why can't I just be content with empty time for relaxing and simply doing nothing? Why do I keep packing my schedule with so many things, stretching myself and leaving myself exhausted at the end of the day? 

I guess this constant questioning of my decisions has left me with much doubt about what the purpose of me doing so much is. In a sense, it's saddening that it's so hard to find validation for what I'm doing, that most around me think I'm just strange and abnormal for wanting to do so much.

At the end of the day, I'm simply trying to find meaning, to find fulfillment. 

I feel that I found a friend in *Ikigai*. Which, objectively, sounds like a nerd move -- how can this inanimate object fill up the role of a human companion? Well, I guess it's more of the immense validation I received from the book -- 
I did gain new insights, but a lot of the ideas presented were already ones that I previously had, but never really dared to act upon. Hearing the experiences of others who have lived through the same, who have found fulfilment from believing in themselves and simply forging ahead boldly, is heartening. I'm just thankful that reading this book gave me the motivation that I need, to keep trusting in myself and keep creating meaning for myself.
